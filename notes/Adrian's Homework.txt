-upload Donate image and link to streamlabs donate link once you link your paypal on streamlabs.

Donating is appreciated but not necessary. 
Your follows, views, and chat engagement are just as appreciated!

-set a time for a consultation with me for an hour or so, if time allows.
this will allow us to review and set up stream commands, timers, mini games and loyalty.
