-Fought in the Main Arena (or rated room) for actual rating/rank
-Possible emote/title/item for top 3 that rotates and has to be "maintained"?


The thoughts behind this are that the top sparrers will likely want to compete and be "exclusive", which makes this more of an esport league.  
There are already tag team / guild / solo spars that offer an open format for all players to compete and win items, statues, etc. 
This will break up those tournaments for lower tier sparrers to compete for a different type of recognition and more likely to succeed or have an even bracket as the "competitive" players focus more on the league.
This also gives people who aren't on the board an opportunity as a "noteworthy recommendation" to fight and succeed against top ranked sparrers...not only to take their "rank/rating", but public community recognition and titles above all
